I made this project my Junior Year of highschool (2017), right after my first class in Java. I wanted to allow people from my church to have an easier time accessing the messages on my church's website and thus built this application. At the time, I also wanted to deepen my understaning of Java and thought that this was the perfect opportunity to do so. The app can be seen on the android app store here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.leon.scaapp&hl=en_US.
