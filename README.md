I built this project my Junior Year of highschool (2017), right after my first class in Java. I wanted to allow people from my church to have an easier time accessing the messages on my church's website. I decided to solve this problem by building an app, which I also deemed as the perfect way to deepen my understaning of Java. The app can be seen on the android app store here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.leon.scaapp&hl=en_US.
